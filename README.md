This project explores the potential for implementing peer-to-peer energy sharing in Denmark, using survey data to identify which individuals are more likely to participate in such systems. The overall aim is to understand how demographic and household characteristics influence attitudes and willingness toward energy sharing, particularly in the context of a growing number of solar panel owners, electric vehicles, and sustainable energy practices.

The dataset consists of 230 responses collected from two groups: current or potential solar panel owners, and individuals interested in receiving shared energy. Before analysis, extensive data cleaning and transformation were conducted. Categorical variables were converted into a usable format using one-hot encoding, and rare or small response categories were grouped under an “Other” label to ensure model stability. Continuous variables like age and income were also categorized into meaningful ranges to aid interpretation. All variable labels were translated from Danish to English for better readability in visualizations and analysis.

The core analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. To avoid overfitting and multicollinearity, several irrelevant or imbalanced variables were removed, such as house type and employment status. Additionally, a variable measuring attitudes toward renewable energy was excluded due to low variation among responses. The model was further refined using LASSO regularization, which automatically removed non-informative variables by shrinking their coefficients to zero. Following that, a Wald test was applied to identify non-significant predictors, and a stepwise backward elimination process was used to simplify the model further.

Key findings include a significantly higher interest in energy sharing among respondents aged 44–50 and 58–80, with positive coefficients indicating they are more likely to participate compared to the 25–43 age group. In contrast, higher income groups—particularly those earning between 600,000–799,999 DKK and over 800,000 DKK—showed a negative relationship with interest in energy sharing. One of the strongest predictors was the respondent’s trust in the concept of energy sharing, supporting the idea that attitudes and perceptions play a crucial role in adoption potential.
